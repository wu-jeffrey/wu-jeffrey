# 👋 Hey[,](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-name-is-jeff) my name is Jeff

I'm an Engineering student at the University of Waterloo and a Former Developer Intern at Shopify! 
I'm in the process of looking for a summer 2021 internship, feel free to reach me at [jeffrey.wu@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:j387wu@uwaterloo.ca) or connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff--wu/)!

## Current Projects
⚔️ WouldYouRather: React and Rails application I'm working on with [@mark-sim](https://github.com/mark-sim). It's an image tournament game where you can pick your favorite(s) out of a group of images (foods, TV shows, sports, basketball players, the possibilities are endless!) 

We plan for it to be a sort of "buzzfeed quiz" game!

The main repo is is private, but check out some of our progress, forked [here](https://github.com/wu-jeffrey/WouldYouRather)!
