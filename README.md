## Current Projects
### ⚔️ WouldYouRather

React and Rails application I'm working on with [@mark-sim](https://github.com/mark-sim). 

It's an image tournament game where you can pick your favorite(s) out of a group of images (foods, TV shows, basketball players, the possibilities are endless!) 

We plan for it to be a sort of "buzzfeed quiz" game!

The main repo is is private, but check out some of our progress, forked [here](https://github.com/wu-jeffrey/WouldYouRather)!

### 🍔 Nutrition Tracker 2

React and NodeJS application

I have a passion for fitness and nutrition, having lost over 80 lbs. After tracking my calories using a plethora of popular apps, I've become frustrated with slow, clunky UIs, or annoying upsells for key features. I built this simple nutrition tracker as a coding challenge and I use it daily to track my macros. It's still got a ways to go before launching it but it's coming along!

Check it out [here](https://github.com/wu-jeffrey/nutrition-tracker-2)!
